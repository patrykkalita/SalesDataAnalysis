# SalesDataAnalysis

A project on analyzing products sold, created using the Python language and the Pandas library.
Visualization of the results was presented using the matplotlib library.

What we can infer from the analysis created:
- In which month was the highest turnover
- From which cities the most products were ordered
- The time in which the most products were purchased
- Which products were most often sold together
- What products were sold in the largest quantities
